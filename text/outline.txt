Objective:
"The overall question we're posing is after analyzing all of the data: 
what trends and best practices can you show for the highly successful 
students in the courses vs. the students who did poorly?"

E.x. 
"Some things to investigate would be time in MyLab, time spent on each 
of the different assignment types, time spent in the eBook, what settings
were given on the assignments ( multiple submissions allowed, late submissions, etc) 
and did that have an impact?.  Did students use Learning Aids in the assignments? Was Covid a factor?"
